# Machine Learning Dependencies (Optional - for future ML model implementation)
# These are large packages and may take time to download
# Install separately when ready to implement actual ML models

# For LSTM models (Time-series forecasting)
tensorflow==2.15.0
# Alternative lighter option: tensorflow-cpu==2.15.0 (CPU-only, smaller download)

# For Prophet (Seasonal forecasting)
prophet==1.1.5
# Note: Prophet requires additional system dependencies:
# - On Windows: Visual C++ Build Tools
# - On Linux/Mac: Usually pre-installed

# Installation instructions:
# 1. Install base requirements first: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. Then install ML dependencies: pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
# 3. If timeout occurs, increase timeout: pip install --default-timeout=1000 -r requirements-ml.txt
